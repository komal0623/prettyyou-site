<h1>About the ASIDE TAG</h1>
<p>Here is a quote from the program:</p>

<blockquote cite="s3.html">
My definition of the aside element would be "information either unrelated or loosely related to the main content of a page should go in aside tags"  however, that is not W3C's definition. They write: "The aside element represents content that is tangentially related to the content that forms the main textual flow of a document."
